# Bonding Tokens Directly On-Chain

*The staking token is the primary capital asset on any POS blockchain. We hope that creating more options for what users can do with their staked tokens will increase the economic activities facilitated by the blockchain.*

Chains created with the Cosmos-SDK usually have an un-bonding period for bonded tokens to become available after a withdrawal request from the network, which can range from 7 - 28 days, leading to a couple of issues for delegators.

1. Bonding tokens directly to the network means the only yield-bearing option available to delegators comes from protocol inflation or fees generated from network activities.

2. It is not possible to transfer bonded tokens to another address without first un-bonding them.

## VaultFi Liquidity Vaults

Vaults are instances of a smart contract that manages staked tokens on behalf of their owner. The benefits of using VaultFi Liquidity Vaults include:

* Instant transfer of vault ownership to another owner/entity.
* Vault owners can choose to open liquidity request options (more on this below).
* Payment streaming, where the vault owner can add a beneficiary who can claim rewards.
* Ability to create multiple vaults for managing different asset groups.
* The flexibility of vault-based asset management encourages more assets to be bonded to the network, which increases overall network security.

## Liquidity Request Options (LROs)

Once staked assets can be managed through a vault, it creates more opportunities for using these assets already bonded to the network in other DeFi use cases, such as:

* Fixed-term rentals
* Fixed-interest rentals
* Fixed-term loans

## Protocol Fees

0.3% fee charged to vault owners on requested liquidity.

## Frontend Implementation

* Dashboard for managing vaults.
* Dashboard for managing LP_GROUPS.
* Marketplace for trading LROs.
