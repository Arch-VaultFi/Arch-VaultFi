### Project Name
**VaultFi**

### Problem Statement
Many cryptocurrency holders face a dilemma when it comes to staking their assets. While staking provides valuable network security and generates rewards, it also locks up liquidity, preventing stakers from accessing their capital when they need it most. This lack of liquidity can be a significant barrier, especially during financial emergencies or investment opportunities, limiting the utility of staked assets.

### Solution
VaultFi addresses this problem by allowing users to unlock USDC liquidity using their staked ARCH tokens as collateral. Our platform offers a secure and efficient way to leverage staked assets without sacrificing staking rewards or network participation. By creating a vault, depositing ARCH tokens, and staking with preferred validators, users can use their vaults as security to access USDC liquidity. For lenders, VaultFi provides an opportunity to lend USDC to these vaults, offering a new avenue for earning interest on their assets.

### How to Get Started for Stakers
1. **Create Your Vault**: Set up a secure vault on the VaultFi platform.
2. **Deposit ARCH Tokens**: Add your ARCH tokens into your vault.
3. **Stake with Validators**: Continue to stake and manage your ARCH tokens with your chosen validators.
4. **Access USDC Liquidity**: Use your vault containing staked ARCH tokens as collateral to obtain USDC liquidity.

### How to Get Started for Lenders
1. **Explore Vault Deals**: Browse available vault deals on the VaultFi platform.
2. **Lend to Vaults**: Choose a vault and provide USDC liquidity to it.
3. **Track and Manage**: Monitor and manage your lending positions across various vaults.
